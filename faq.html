<h3>What is MSAC and what does it do?</h3>
  <p>MSAC is the McGill Student's Anime Club. We are a group of students that promotes anime, manga, and other related subjects in the greater Montreal region.</p>
  <p>During the semester, we host weekly events, both online (on discord) and in-person.To promote socialization among our members, we offer a mixture of official-club-sponsored activities (lead by the executive team) as well as unnoficial activities (lead by the community).</p>

    <h3>Do you organize anything else?</h3>

  <h4>Costume Contest</h4>
  <p>In 2021, we hosted our first costume contest. We understand that cosplays can be expensive. Thus, the term costume was very open ended. We encouraged members to participate even with a simple costume. We are hoping to make this event into an annual tradition </p>
  <h4>Maid Cafe</h4>
 <p>In non-covid times, the maid cafe is the biggest MSAC event that we look forward to organizing every year. Attendees can enjoy food and drinks that are served by lovely maids and butlers as well as play games.</p>
<p>In 2022, through the maid cafe, we raised more than 700$, all of which was donated to <a href="http://animatorsupporters.com/" target="_blank">Animator Supporters</a> </p>
<p>Organizing the maid cafe is a lot of work, thus each year, we are always looking for volunteers to help us out.</p>

  <h3>How do I become a member of MSAC?</h3>
  <p>There is no membership process to join MSAC. You become a member the moment you join any of the club's activities </p>

  <h3>How do I become an exec?</h3>
